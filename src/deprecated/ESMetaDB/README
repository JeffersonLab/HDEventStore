This is attempt to make Cleo Meta Data service originally created by CS department.
Requirements:
- python 2.4
- CherryPy version 3.x
- SQLAlchemy 0.4
- elementtree and cElementTree as of 20081216

The web server is based on CherryPy and written in python, see CleoMetaDataServer.py
The initial environment is set by setup.sh, please adjust as necessary
To access underlying MySQL, please create DBParam file with the following content:
[Global]
user=<db_user_name>
pass=<db_user_password>
host=lnx150.lns.cornell.edu
db=CleoMetaDB

The MySQL DB should be named as CleoMetaDB (or anything wrt to db= parameter above).
It's schema is placed in db subdirectory, see README over there for migratin steps from MSSQL
to MySQL v4.x

To test the service, use test_client.sh script which invoke soap.py with given parameters.
